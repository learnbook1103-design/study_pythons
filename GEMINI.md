# Project Overview

This directory contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, likely intended for learning and practicing fundamental Python programming concepts. The files cover topics such as variables (lists, dictionaries), control flow (if statements, while loops), functions, classes, modules, file I/O, error handling, and data structures.

## Directory Contents

The `codes/` directory contains the following files:

*   `01_variables_string.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of strings.
*   `02_variables_list.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of lists.
*   `03_variables_dict.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of dictionaries.
*   `04_variables_bundles.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating more complex variable structures.
*   `04_variables_bundles_more.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with further examples of complex variable structures.
*   `05_ifs.py`: A Python script demonstrating the use of `if` statements for conditional logic.
*   `06_whiles.py`: A Python script demonstrating the use of `while` loops.
*   `07_functions.py`: A Python script demonstrating the use of functions.
*   `08_classes.py`: A Python script demonstrating the use of classes.
*   `09_modules.py`: A Python script demonstrating the use of modules.
*   `10_file_io.py`: A Python script demonstrating file input/output operations.
*   `11_error_handling.py`: A Python script demonstrating error handling.
*   `12_data_structures.py`: A Python script demonstrating common data structures.

## Building and Running

These files are not part of a larger application and can be run individually.

### Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)

To run the Jupyter notebook files, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You can then navigate to the `codes/` directory and run the desired notebook.

### Python Scripts (`.py`)

To run the Python script files, you can use the `python` interpreter from your terminal. For example, to run `05_ifs.py`:

```bash
python codes/05_ifs.py
```

## Development Conventions

There are no explicit development conventions, as this appears to be a collection of individual learning files rather than a collaborative project.
